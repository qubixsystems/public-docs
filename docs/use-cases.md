## Use Cases

### Manufacturing Floor Coordination

**Scenario**: A factory uses robotic arms from Universal Robots and mobile robots from MiR.

**Traditional Approach**: Custom integration software, vendor-specific APIs, manual coordination protocols.

**QUBIX Solution**: Deploy a single QUBIX contract that coordinates pick-and-place operations. When the UR arm finishes assembly, it automatically signals the MiR robot to transport the part - all through standardized QUBIX protocols.

**Benefits**: 
- Reduced integration time from months to weeks
- Single codebase for multi-vendor coordination
- Automatic scalability to additional robot types

### Cross-Facility Inspection Standardization

**Scenario**: An energy company operates multiple sites with different inspection robots (Boston Dynamics Spot at some locations, Clearpath Husky at others).

**QUBIX Solution**: Write one QUBIX inspection contract that defines patrol routes and data collection requirements. The same contract deploys to all robots regardless of manufacturer.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent inspection processes across facilities
- Single training program for operators
- Unified data collection and reporting

### Shared Robot Pool for Small Manufacturers

**Scenario**: Three small manufacturers in an industrial park want to share robot resources instead of each buying their own fleet.

**QUBIX Solution**: Smart contracts handle scheduling, authentication, and billing automatically. A robot finishing a job at Company A can immediately transition to Company B's tasks without manual reconfiguration.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced capital expenditure for small businesses
- Improved robot utilization rates
- Automated resource sharing without complex legal agreements

### University Research Lab Collaboration

**Scenario**: Robotics labs at different universities want to share and test each other's navigation algorithms.

**Traditional Challenge**: Rewriting code for each lab's different robot platforms.

**QUBIX Solution**: Publish verified navigation contracts on QUBIX. A behavior developed on Turtlebots at MIT can immediately run on Jackals at Carnegie Mellon.

**Benefits**:
- Accelerated research through code sharing
- Cross-platform algorithm validation
- Reduced duplicate development efforts

### Multi-Vendor Warehouse Operations

**Scenario**: A logistics center uses AGVs from multiple suppliers due to different delivery timelines and requirements.

**QUBIX Solution**: Unified fleet management interface where all robots appear as standardized agents, regardless of whether they're from Amazon Robotics, Locus, or local integrators.

**Benefits**:
- Vendor flexibility without integration overhead
- Unified operational dashboard
- Simplified maintenance and updates
