## Team

### Founder: Marcus

QUBIX was founded by Marcus, a robotics engineer with over a decade of hands-on experience in ROS2 development and real-world robot deployments. His career spans from research labs to production environments, where he repeatedly encountered the same fundamental problem: robots trapped in proprietary silos, unable to collaborate across vendor boundaries.

**Expertise**:
- **Distributed Robotics Middleware**: Deep experience with multi-robot coordination systems
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized in getting different robot types to work together
- **Production Deployments**: Real-world experience with the challenges of robot integration
- **ROS2 Development**: Over 10 years of experience with Robot Operating System

**Vision**: Having built custom integration layers between different robot platforms countless times, Marcus recognized that the industry needed a universal application layer - not another point solution, but foundational infrastructure that makes vendor-agnostic robot development possible.

### Core Team

The QUBIX team combines deep robotics domain knowledge with blockchain infrastructure expertise:

- **Robotics Engineers**: Former engineers from major robotics companies who experienced the integration tax firsthand
- **Blockchain Developers**: Infrastructure experts who understand how to build decentralized protocols that work in production
- **Systems Integration Specialists**: Engineers with experience bridging different robot platforms and protocols

**Shared Experience**: All team members have direct experience with the pain points QUBIX solves, ensuring the platform addresses real-world developer needs rather than theoretical problems.
