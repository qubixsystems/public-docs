## Introduction

Modern robotics development faces a fundamental infrastructure problem. Robots from different manufacturers speak different protocols, rely on vendor-specific cloud services, and require extensive integration work to collaborate. Developers spend more time building bridges between closed ecosystems than building actual robot applications.

**QUBIX introduces the decentralized application layer for robots** - a blockchain-native infrastructure that standardizes how robots discover, communicate, and collaborate across organizational boundaries.

### Key Benefits

With QUBIX, developers can orchestrate mixed fleets of Boston Dynamics Spots, Universal Robots arms, and custom hardware through a single API. Robot behaviors become composable smart contracts that can be shared, verified, and deployed across any QUBIX-enabled device. Teams can build cross-platform robot applications without vendor lock-in or proprietary middleware.

### Real Developer Use Cases

- **Cross-vendor orchestration**: Deploy the same inspection workflow across Spot robots and wheeled platforms using unified QUBIX contracts
- **Decentralized fleet management**: Manage robot clusters without dependency on AWS RoboMaker or Azure IoT Hub
- **Composable robot skills**: Import verified navigation and manipulation behaviors from the QUBIX registry instead of rebuilding from scratch
- **Verifiable deployments**: Push firmware updates with cryptographic verification and automatic rollback capabilities

### Vision

QUBIX was founded by Marcus, a robotics engineer with over a decade in ROS2 and production robot deployments. After repeatedly hitting the walls of closed ecosystems and proprietary integration layers, he built QUBIX as the open, blockchain-native foundation that robotics development actually needs.
